Kamina is a free-spirited loose cannon bent on making a name for himself, while Simon is a timid young boy with no real aspirations. One day while excavating the earth, Simon stumbles upon a mysterious object that turns out to be the ignition key to an ancient artifact of war, which the duo dubs Lagann. Using their new weapon, Simon and Kamina fend off a surprise attack from the surface with the help of Yoko Littner, a hot-blooded redhead wielding a massive gun who wanders the world above.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the sky is now in plain view, prompting Simon and Kamina to set off on a journey alongside Yoko to explore the wastelands of the surface. Soon, they join the fight against the \"Beastmen,\" humanoid creatures that terrorize the remnants of humanity in powerful robots called \"Gunmen.\" Although they face some challenges and setbacks, the trio bravely fights these new enemies alongside other survivors to reclaim the surface, while slowly unraveling a galaxy-sized mystery.\n\n[Written by MAL

uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.\n \nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with

Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of Battousai still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as Kenshin Himura, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, Kenshin dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai. After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.\n\nRurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan tells the story of Kenshin as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?\n\n[Written by MAL

Roger was known as the \"Pirate King,\" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\n\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]

world faces a new threat: monstrous celestial beings called \"Angels\" invade Tokyo-3 one by one. Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed \"Evangelions\" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.\n\nYears after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou's 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji's life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced.\n\nA devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father's dark machinations.\n\n[Written by MAL

However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias \"Kira\"—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is

This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.\n\nDue to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.\n\nBullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\n[Written by MAL

luxury. However, the fate of the future queen of France is set in stone—at the young age of 15, she has to leave her family and marry the crown prince of France.\n\nAt the same time in France, a girl is born in the family of the Commander of the Royal Guards. Upset at not having a male heir, her father decides to raise her as a man and names the girl Oscar. Oscar is trained from a young age to become the leader of the Royal Guards, but she is yet to discern that the will of the queen sometimes does not equal the good of the people.\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed manga by Riyoko Ikeda, Rose of Versailles depicts the fateful meeting of Marie Antoinette and Oscar, which is bound to influence history and change the life of the people facing the French Revolution as the clock ticks toward the end of the French royalty.\n\n[Written by MAL

harbor secrets that are related to girls, Takashi Natsume has a peculiar and terrifying secret involving youkai: for as long as he can remember, he has been constantly chased by these spirits. Natsume soon discovers that his deceased grandmother Reiko had passed on to him the Yuujinchou, or \"Book of Friends,\" which contains the names of the spirits whom she brought under her control. Now in Natsume's possession, the book gives Reiko's grandson this power as well, which is why these enraged beings now haunt him in hopes of somehow attaining their freedom.\n\nWithout parents and a loving home, and constantly being hunted by hostile, merciless youkai, Natsume is looking for solace—a place where he belongs. However, his only companion is a self-proclaimed bodyguard named Madara. Fondly referred to as Nyanko-sensei, Madara is a mysterious, pint-sized feline spirit who has his own reasons for sticking with the boy.\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed manga by Yuki Midorikawa, Natsume Yuujinchou is an unconventional and supernatural slice-of-life series that follows Natsume as he, with his infamous protector Madara, endeavors to free the spirits bound by his grandmother's contract.\n\n[Written by MAL

However, Kotarou is forced to remain on the run when he finds himself being hunted down by assassins sent by China's Ming Dynasty for mysterious reasons not involving his petty crimes. \n\nFortunately, the duo run into Nanashi, a ronin who has taken refuge in a small temple, when Kotarou is attacked and Tobimaru poisoned. Although the samurai  saves the helpless pair from their pursuers, he feels that there is no need to help them further; but when offered a gem in exchange for his services as a bodyguard, he reluctantly accepts Kotarou's offer of employment—just until Tobimaru is healed and the two reach their destination. As the three set out on a perilous journey, it soon becomes evident that their path is riddled with danger, as the Ming Dynasty has now sent a terrifying swordsman after them to capture Kotarou and fulfill a certain prophecy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.28,"rank":246,"popularity":616,"num_list_users":296053,"num_scoring_users":147795,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2007-05-01T16:11:08+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T08:22:20+00:00","media_type":"movie","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":13,"name":"Historical"},{"id":21,"name":"Samurai"}],"num_episodes":1,"start_season":{"year":2007,"season":"summer"},"source":"original","average_episode_duration":6180,"rating":"r","characters":[{"id":43179,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-374073347.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Feng-wu","desc":"Feng-wu is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43182,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-1093386431.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Jurota Inui","desc":"Jurota Inui is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":15573,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/thumbs/1861266340.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Kotarou","desc":"Kotarou is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43178,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-1751863818.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Luo-Lang ","desc":"Luo-Lang  is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43180,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-1631220361.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Mu-Mao","desc":"Mu-Mao is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":25478,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/3594-641005919.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Nanashi","desc":"Nanashi is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43181,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-825787167.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Shouan","desc":"Shouan is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43157,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-415005963.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Shougen Itadori","desc":"Shougen Itadori is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."},{"id":43177,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/5305-227294895.jpg","gender":"Unknown","name":"Tobimaru ","desc":"Tobimaru  is a character from the movie Sword of the Stranger."}]},"100120":{"id":170,"title":"Slam Dunk","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/86890.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/86890l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":[],"en":"Slam Dunk","ja":"スラムダンク"},"start_date":"1993-10-16","end_date":"1996-03-23","synopsis":"Hanamichi Sakuragi, infamous for his temper, massive height, and fire-red hair, enrolls in Shohoku High, hoping to finally get a girlfriend and break his record of being rejected 50 consecutive times in middle school.

Goldenbaum Dynasty in order to free his sister from the Kaiser and unify humanity under one genuine ruler. Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.\n\nAs ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.\n\n[Written by

Despite this, he possesses an impressive batting ability honed by frequent visits to the local baseball batting center run by the Tsukushima family. On the other hand, Aoba loves to play baseball and is a star player with exceptional pitching form.\n\nHowever, these two seemingly complete opposites share something very important to them—Wakaba Tsukishima, Aoba's older sister and Kou's destined sweetheart. Admired by the quarrelsome duo, Wakaba often finds herself the catalyst to their never-ending rivalry. But whether or not they realize that they have more in common than either would care to admit, only time will tell.

a small teahouse. That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\n\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep

Despite his remarkable abilities, however, Tokuchi sees the sport as nothing more than a way to make some quick money.\n\nWhen Hiromichi Kojima, a legendary hitter for the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, witnesses Tokuchi's skills firsthand, he realizes that the man might be exactly what the team needs to get out of their slump. Determined to recruit Tokuchi no matter what, Kojima places his own career on the line and defeats Tokuchi at his own specialty—One Outs.\n\nForced to become a Lycaon, Tokuchi soon finds himself at odds with the team's owner, Tsuneo Saikawa. After Saikawa refuses to give him a reasonable salary, Tokuchi proposes a special contract: pitching an out will earn him five million yen, but giving up a run will cost him fifty million.

most unique one: Kyotouryuu, a technique in which the user's own body is wielded as a blade. The enigmatic seventh head of the Kyotouryuu school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister Nanami until one day—the wildly ambitious strategist Togame barges into their lives.\n\nTogame brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the \"Deviant Blades,\" for the shogunate. Shichika accepts, interested in the girl herself rather than petty politics, and thus sets out on a journey. Standing in their way are the fierce wielders of these legendary weapons as well as other power-hungry entities who seek to thwart Togame's objective. In order to prevail against their enemies, the duo must become an unbreakable team as they forge ahead on a path of uncertainty and peril.\n\n[Written by MAL

be caught in their grasp. On the other side is Hellsing, an organization dedicated to destroying these supernatural forces that threaten the very existence of humanity. At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead.\n\nIntegra's vast army, however, pales in comparison with her ultimate weapon: the vampire Alucard, who works against his own kind as an exterminator for Hellsing. With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil.\n\nIn a battle for mankind's survival, Hellsing Ultimate proves that appearances are not all they may seem, and sometimes the greatest weapon can come in the form of one's worst nightmare.\n\n[Written by MAL

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL

special school for psychics. However, unease looms as Saki begins to question the fate of those unable to awaken to their powers, and the children begin to get involved with secretive matters such as the rumored Tainted Cats said to abduct children.\n\nShinsekai yori tells the unique coming-of-age story of Saki and her friends as they journey to grow into their roles in the supposed utopia.

\"Medicine Seller\" is a deadly and mysterious master of the occult who travels across feudal Japan in search of malevolent spirits called \"mononoke\" to slay. When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative work—an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.\n\nThe Medicine Seller's journey leads him to an old-fashioned inn where Shino, a pregnant woman, has finally found a place to rest. The owner has reluctantly placed her in the last vacant room; however, as she settles in, it quickly becomes clear that the room is infested by a lethal band of mononoke, the Zashiki Warashi. With his hunter's intuition, the Medicine Seller begins his investigation to discover the Form, the Truth, and the Reason before the Zashiki Warashi can kill again.\n\n[Written by MAL

small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the \"King of the Court,\" Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.\n\nThanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL

Handa is an up-and-coming calligrapher: young, handsome, talented, and unfortunately, a narcissist to boot. When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as \"unoriginal,\" Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.\n\nAs punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu's father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style—that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.39,"rank":169,"popularity":274,"num_list_users":581930,"num_scoring_users":297025,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2014-02-20T18:38:08+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T02:38:45+00:00","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":36,"name":"Slice of Life"}],"num_episodes":12,"start_season":{"year":2014,"season":"summer"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"sunday","start_time":"02:20"},"source":"web_manga","average_episode_duration":1370,"rating":"pg_13","characters":[{"id":68760,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1736748669.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Akihiko Arai","desc":"Akihiko Arai is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":70094,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/25380-804957020.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Akiko Kido","desc":"Akiko Kido is a character from the anime Barakamon.","anime_id":104117},{"id":70093,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/25380-1175057231.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Daisuke","desc":"Daisuke is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":70096,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/25380-658267347.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Director","desc":"Director is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68765,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1526579249.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Hina Kubota","desc":"Hina Kubota is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68763,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1367935242.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Hiroshi Kido","desc":"Hiroshi Kido is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68767,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-332186231.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Kazuyuki Sakamoto","desc":"Kazuyuki Sakamoto is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68766,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1281108105.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Kentarou Oohama","desc":"Kentarou Oohama is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68761,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1047332273.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Kousuke Kanzaki","desc":"Kousuke Kanzaki is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68768,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-675697667.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Miwa Yamamura","desc":"Miwa Yamamura is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68758,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-823210753.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Naru Kotoishi","desc":"Naru Kotoishi is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":55049,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-35477465.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Seishuu Handa","desc":"Seishuu Handa is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68762,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1449716083.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Takao Kawafuji","desc":"Takao Kawafuji is a character from the anime Barakamon.","anime_id":104117},{"id":68759,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1807592575.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Tamako Arai","desc":"Tamako Arai is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":70095,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/25380-896394254.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Yutaka","desc":"Yutaka is a character from the anime Barakamon."},{"id":68764,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-376067748.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Yuujirou Kido","desc":"Yuujirou Kido is a character from the anime Barakamon."}]},"104135":{"id":22135,"title":"Ping Pong the Animation","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/58041.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/58041l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":["PPTA"],"en":"Ping Pong the Animation","ja":"ピンポン THE ANIMATION"},"start_date":"2014-04-11","end_date":"2014-06-20","synopsis":"\"The hero comes.

a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, Saitama relentlessly trained for three years, losing all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is so powerful, he can defeat any enemy with just one punch. However, having no one capable of matching his strength has led Saitama to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.\n\nOne day, Saitama catches the attention of 19-year-old cyborg Genos, who witnesses his power and wishes to become Saitama’s disciple. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society. Saitama, who is shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. Meeting new allies and taking on new foes, Saitama embarks on a new journey as a member of the Hero Association to experience the excitement of battle he once felt.\n\n[Written by MAL

Even though she nurses ambitious dreams of removing herself from her provincial roots and finding her true calling, she ends up traveling to Tokyo with the humble reason of chasing her current boyfriend Shouji Endo.\n\nNana Osaki, on the other hand, is a proud, enigmatic punk rock vocalist from a similarly rural background, who nurtures the desire to become a professional singer. Putting her career with a fairly popular band (and her passionate romance with one of its former members) firmly behind her, she boards the same train to Tokyo as Nana Komatsu.\n\nThrough a fateful encounter in their journey toward the metropolis, the young women with the same given name are brought together, sparking a chain of events which eventually result in them sharing an apartment. As their friendship deepens, the two attempt to support each other through thick and thin, their deeply intertwined lives filled with romance, music, challenges, and heartbreaks that will ultimately test their seemingly unbreakable bond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.51,"rank":105,"popularity":323,"num_list_users":524431,"num_scoring_users":187219,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2006-04-11T23:58:13+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T08:33:36+00:00","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":19,"name":"Music"},{"id":22,"name":"Romance"},{"id":25,"name":"Shoujo"},{"id":36,"name":"Slice of Life"}],"num_episodes":47,"start_season":{"year":2006,"season":"spring"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1380,"rating":"r+","characters":[{"id":71027,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-320415156.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Ema Kanzaki","desc":"Ema Kanzaki is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71026,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-356818536.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Himari Ichijou","desc":"Himari Ichijou is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71030,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-213949005.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Isami Momoki","desc":"Isami Momoki is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai.","anime_id":104302},{"id":71029,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-717019112.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Kana Konoe","desc":"Kana Konoe is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71033,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-608579739.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Mahiro Amamiya","desc":"Mahiro Amamiya is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71031,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1845795318.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Manaka Ninomiya","desc":"Manaka Ninomiya is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71028,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-470692880.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Misuzu Kirishima","desc":"Misuzu Kirishima is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71025,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-80798063.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Riho Ayabe","desc":"Riho Ayabe is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71032,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-186931897.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Yuno Shinonome","desc":"Yuno Shinonome is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai."},{"id":71024,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/11498-1315202661.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Yuuji Ichijou","desc":"Yuuji Ichijou is a character from the eroge 1/7 no Mahoutsukai.","anime_id":104302}]},"104307":{"id":17074,"title":"Monogatari Series: Second Season","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/52133.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/52133l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":["Nekomonogatari: Shiro","Kabukimonogatari: Mayoi Jianshi","Otorimonogatari","Onimonogatari","Koimonogatari"],"en":"Monogatari Series: Second Season","ja":"〈物語〉シリーズ セカンドシーズン"},"start_date":"2013-07-07","end_date":"2013-12-29","synopsis":"Apparitions, oddities, and gods continue to manifest around Koyomi Araragi and his close-knit group of friends: Tsubasa Hanekawa, the group's modest genius; Shinobu Oshino, the resident doughnut-loving vampire; athletic deviant Suruga Kanbaru; bite-happy spirit Mayoi Hachikuji; Koyomi's cutesy stalker Nadeko Sengoku; and Hitagi Senjogahara, the poignant tsundere.\n\nMonogatari Series: Second Season revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching.

Morioh, a normally quiet and peaceful town, has recently become a hotbed of strange activity. Joutarou Kuujou, now a marine biologist, heads to the mysterious town to meet Jousuke Higashikata. While the two may seem like strangers at first, Jousuke is actually the illegitimate child of Joutarou's grandfather, Joseph Joestar. When they meet, Joutarou realizes that he may have more in common with Jousuke than just a blood relation.\n\nAlong with the mild-mannered Kouichi Hirose and the boisterous Okuyasu Nijimura, the group dedicates themselves to investigating recent disappearances and other suspicious occurrences within Morioh. Aided by the power of Stands, the four men will encounter danger at every street corner, as it is up to them to unravel the town's secrets, before another occurs.\n\n[Written by MAL

Having just qualified to participate in Redline, he is eager to battle against the other highly skilled drivers, particularly the beautiful rising star and the only other human that qualified, Sonoshee McLaren.\n\nBut this year's Redline may be far more dangerous than usual—it has been announced to take place on the planet Roboworld with its trigger-happy military and criminals who look to turn the race to their own advantage. However, the potential danger doesn't stop the racers; in fact, it only adds to the thrill. Relying solely on his vehicle's speed, JP prepares for the event to come, aiming to take first place in the biggest race of his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.29,"rank":242,"popularity":569,"num_list_users":315153,"num_scoring_users":171598,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2009-06-24T20:32:54+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T04:36:33+00:00","media_type":"movie","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":3,"name":"Cars"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":30,"name":"Sports"}],"num_episodes":1,"start_season":{"year":2009,"season":"summer"},"source":"original","average_episode_duration":6120,"rating":"r+","characters":[{"id":77124,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/33496-1274854330.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"JP","desc":"JP is a character from the movie Redline."},{"id":77123,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/33496-863651273.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Sonoshee McLaren","desc":"Sonoshee McLaren is a character from the movie Redline."}]},"104871":{"id":32182,"title":"Mob Psycho 100","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/80356.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/80356l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":["Mob Psycho Hyaku","Mob Psycho One Hundred"],"en":"Mob Psycho 100","ja":"モブサイコ100"},"start_date":"2016-07-11","end_date":"2016-09-27","synopsis":"Eighth-grader Shigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.\n\nIn order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile.\n\n[Written by MAL

After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice.\n\nAs he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific rakugo performer, passed away.

across the country. However, following feudal Japan's surrender to powerful aliens known as the \"Amanto,\" those aspirations now seem unachievable. With the once-influential shogunate rebuilt as a puppet government, a new law is passed that promptly prohibits all swords in public. \n\nEnter Gintoki Sakata, an eccentric silver-haired man who always carries around a wooden sword and maintains his stature as a samurai despite the ban. As the founder of Yorozuya, a small business for odd jobs, Gintoki often embarks on endeavors to help other people—though usually in rather strange and unforeseen ways. \n\nAssisted by Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses supposedly learning the way of the samurai; Kagura, a tomboyish girl with superhuman strength and an endless appetite; and Sadaharu, their giant pet dog who loves biting on people's heads, the Yorozuya encounter anything from alien royalty to scuffles with local gangs in the ever-changing world of Edo.\n\n[Written by MAL

for Kusuo Saiki, however, this couldn't be further from the truth. Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where ignorance is bliss.\n\nUnfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot more difficult to achieve than expected.\n\n[Written by MAL

humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL

their entire lives to inherit one of the seven Titans under Marley's control and aid their nation in eradicating the Eldians on Paradis. However, just as all seems well for the two cadets, their peace is suddenly shaken by the arrival of Eren Yeager and the remaining members of the Survey Corps.\n\nHaving finally reached the Yeager family basement and learned about the dark history surrounding the Titans, the Survey Corps has at long last found the answer they so desperately fought to uncover. With the truth now in their hands, the group set out for the world beyond the walls.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season, two utterly different worlds collide as each party pursues its own agenda in the long-awaited conclusion to Paradis' fight for freedom.\n\n[Written by MAL

Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.73,"rank":42,"popularity":104,"num_list_users":1027442,"num_scoring_users":534167,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2018-03-19T13:28:36+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T08:34:10+00:00","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":13,"name":"Historical"},{"id":42,"name":"Seinen"}],"num_episodes":24,"start_season":{"year":2019,"season":"summer"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"monday","start_time":"00:10"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1492,"rating":"r","characters":[{"id":97960,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/1-37314579.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Ari","desc":"Ari is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97945,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-849203291.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Askeladd","desc":"Askeladd is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":107056,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/71822-694712791.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Bjorn","desc":"Bjorn is a character from the anime Vinland Saga.","anime_id":106514},{"id":97943,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-368827607.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Canute","desc":"Canute is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97941,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-75198712.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Floki","desc":"Floki is a character from the anime Vinland Saga.","anime_id":106514},{"id":97948,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/1-1369654209.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Halfdan","desc":"Halfdan is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97939,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-1124473320.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Helga","desc":"Helga is a character from the anime Vinland Saga.","anime_id":106514},{"id":97947,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/1-1554801286.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Leif Ericson","desc":"Leif Ericson is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97946,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-1792222717.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Thorfinn","desc":"Thorfinn is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97944,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-1760055716.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Thorkell","desc":"Thorkell is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."},{"id":97942,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-529320770.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Thors Snorresson","desc":"Thors Snorresson is a character from the anime Vinland Saga.","anime_id":106514},{"id":97940,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/52812-968493708.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Ylva","desc":"Ylva is a character from the anime Vinland Saga."}]},"106516":{"id":39533,"title":"Given","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/102238.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1666/102238l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":[],"en":"","ja":"ギヴン"},"start_date":"2019-07-12","end_date":"2019-09-20","synopsis":"Tightly clutching his Gibson guitar, Mafuyu Satou steps out of his dark apartment to begin another day of his high school life.

Now, he ascends to the heavenly realm for the third time, but simply as a pitiful scrap-collecting god with no followers behind him. \n\nOn his first mission, Xie Lian finds himself alone in the dark moonlit night. There, a gentle man dressed in red guides him through the forest. However, as abruptly as he appeared, the man suddenly dissipates into a swarm of silver butterflies.\n\nXie Lian later learns that this mysterious stranger was none other than Hua Cheng, the Crimson Rain Sought Flower, a Ghost King feared by both demons and gods alike. But before Xie Lian can figure out why Hua Cheng would help a Heavenly Official like himself, he meets San Lang. A young man possessing great knowledge on not only the Ghost King, but also the now forgotten Crown Prince, San Lang decides to accompany Xie Lian on his journey of unveiling the mysteries of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.39,"rank":170,"popularity":1958,"num_list_users":79126,"num_scoring_users":28989,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2019-11-17T12:48:20+00:00","updated_at":"2022-02-23T07:33:43+00:00","media_type":"ona","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":13,"name":"Historical"},{"id":37,"name":"Supernatural"}],"num_episodes":11,"start_season":{"year":2020,"season":"fall"},"source":"novel","average_episode_duration":1500,"rating":"pg_13","characters":[{"id":106030,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/37362-41116823.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Feng Xin","desc":"Feng Xin is a character from the Donghua ( Chinese ) Heaven Official's Blessing."},{"id":106027,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/37362-447149400.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Hua Cheng","desc":"Hua Cheng is a character from the Donghua ( Chinese ) Heaven Official's Blessing."},{"id":106028,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/37362-931213013.jpg","gender":"Female","name":"Ling Wen","desc":"Ling Wen is a character from the Donghua ( Chinese ) Heaven Official's Blessing."},{"id":106029,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/37362-168560036.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Mu Qing","desc":"Mu Qing is a character from the Donghua ( Chinese ) Heaven Official's Blessing."},{"id":106026,"character_image":"https://ami.animecharactersdatabase.com/uploads/chars/thumbs/200/37362-1602451008.jpg","gender":"Male","name":"Xie Lian","desc":"Xie Lian is a character from the Donghua ( Chinese ) Heaven Official's Blessing."}]},"107435":{"id":37208,"title":"Mo Dao Zu Shi","main_picture":{"medium":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1253/93893.jpg","large":"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1253/93893l.jpg"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":["Modao Zushi","Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation","The Founder of Diabolism","Mo Dao Zu Shi: Qianchen Pian","魔道祖师 前尘篇","Madou Soshi"],"en":"","ja":"魔道祖师"},"start_date":"2018-07-09","end_date":"2018-10-06","synopsis":"Xian: the state of immortality that all cultivators strive to achieve.

When a chance encounter with a shadow creature should have left him traumatized, it instead makes him believe that he has found a friend amidst those who only choose to notice his shortcomings. He starts meeting with Kage, the shadow, regularly, to the point where even the otherwise abrasive creature begins to warm up to him.\n\nKage and Bojji's unlikely friendship lays the budding foundations of the prince's journey, one where he intends to conquer his fears and insecurities.
